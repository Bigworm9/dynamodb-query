# dynamodb-query
Hi everyone, I'm excited to guide you through basic operations of Amazon DynamoDB. We'll start by accessing the AWS console, creating a key-value table, adding and reading data, and querying the table for specific items. Finally, we'll learn how to delete data at both the item and table levels. I'll use a music library as an example. Enjoy!
